This project outlines the process to execute the application against a server. 

A server is running at https://xamuniversityent410.azurewebsites.net and the app is already configured
to use that service. If you want to run one locally, you will need to configure the connection string in
the Server\ServerSyncApi project. In addition you will need to change the details in the 
CustomerSync/RestClient/CustomerRestClient.cs file to point to your servers location.
