# Customer Sync Server

This project outlines the process to execute the application against a server. 

You can run this service locally by configuring a connection string in
the Server\ServerSyncApi project. In addition you will need to change the details in the 
CustomerSync/RestClient/CustomerRestClient.cs file to point to your servers location either locally or in Azure.
